        On 22nd December 2012, the foundation  organized two day National <strong>Conference</strong> &ldquo;<strong>Integrated Farming Systems for  Sustainable Agriculture in Global Market : Challenges and Opportunities</strong>&rdquo; on  22-23 December, 2012 at Seminar Hall, Department of Philosophy and Religion,  Faculty of Arts, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi <u>partially sponsored by  Council of Scientific Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New  Delhi, BRNS, Mumbai, and Ministry of Earth Sciences, Govt. of India, New Delhi</u>.

Chunekar</strong>, Formers Head, Department of Dravyaguna, Faculty of Ayurveda, Institute of Medical   Sciences, Banaras Hindu University,  Varanasi. 225  Participants, teachers, students and farmers participated in this National  Conference.<br>
        On 7th  February 2012, the foundation organized the &ldquo;Mahila Aur Samaj&rdquo; at Office of  Mahima Research Foundation and Social Welfare, 194, Karaundi, BHU, Varanasi In  this programme Ratnesh Kumar Rao, Secretary, Mahima Research Foundation and  Social welfare said that such views, common in medieval times as well as in restrictive  theocratic societies today, have no legitimacy in a modern democracy. Our laws  protect women against molestation or worse, irrespective of how they dress,  behave or live their lives. These laws, and modern civilisation, deem that even  so-called &quot;women of loose morals&quot; deserve the same protection of the  law as those who are paragons of virtue. Further, that irrespective of whether  it is commonsensical for women to dress conservatively in certain situations,  it is nevertheless legal for them to not do so; and that men who treat them as  fair game for assault are in fact the ones breaking the law. <br>
        Indian courts are  generally progressive and have repeatedly upheld the rights of women, setting  judicial precedents that afford them better protection. For instance, the  higher courts have overruled trial courts that made allowances in favour of  rapists on account of their victims' alleged promiscuity. As a result the law  no longer permits the questioning of rape victims' morals in the courtroom.  That is not to say that judges are immune from personal prejudices; there have  been ins-tances where even high court judges have commented on what women ought  to wear to avoid provoking men; but such attitudes have not found their way  into case law.<br>
        Prof. A.K. Rai, Department  of Philosophy and Religion, Banaras Hindu University,  Varanasi said that the Status of Rural Women in India, &ldquo;you can  tell the condition of a nation by looking at the status of its women&rdquo;-  Jawaharlal Nehru. Emphatic words by one of our country&rsquo;s premier leaders. The  statement stresses the role women have to play in our society. India is  currently witnessing a revolution of sorts in economy and the technological  sectors, yet even 60 years after independence, women&rsquo;s liberation seems a  distant dream. As a country with more than seventy percent of its population  residing in rural areas, it is worthwhile to examine the condition of women in  our villages. A closer look at them reveals a striking paradox for a country  poised to take the leap to becoming a super power in the not-soâ€“distant future.  Women are the pillars on which the family unit stands but rural women present a  picture of abject poverty and exploitation both inside and outside the home. A  vicious circle of malnutrition, ill-health and decreased productivity plagues  them even today.<br>
        Prof. D.N. Tiwari, Head, Department of Philosophy  and Religion, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi said that urban women in India always had more advantages and  opportunities than women residing in rural places. Better education, better  economic resources, and more availability of required things for urban women  and yet rural women have made rapid improvements despite lacking in basic  facilities. No, we have yet to attain the state of complete women empowerment  but signs of gradual improvement are definitely there. India in last  few decades has remained more of a male-dominated society.<br>
        On 12th February 2013, the foundation  organized &ldquo;Mahila Sashaktikaran&rdquo; at Seminar Hall, Mahima Research Foundation  and Social welfare, 194, Karaundi, BHU, Varanasi.  It was inaugurated by <strong>Chief Guest Dr. Mithlesh  Kumar</strong>, Reproductive and sexual health of women is of immense importance as  a result of abuse whether in the family or at public sectors. These include  injuries, gynecological problems, temporary or permanent disabilities,  depressions which in extreme cases culminate in suicide. A psychological  disorder that is typically emarked in victims of domestic violence is post  traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Central/State Government should adopt or  implement and review and analyze legislation to ensure its effectiveness in  eliminating violence against women. Institutional mechanisms should be  strengthened so that women and girls can report acts of violence against them  in a same time psycho-educative programmes are very important for encouraging  self-respect and minimizing power imbalance between men and women in the  society. Women is the infrastructure of society, hence development of women is  very essential without which society&rsquo;s development could not be completed.<br>
        Dr. Madhavi Prasad Kesari said that in  India,  the status of girl child reflects serious gender based difference, inequalities  and discrimination. Boys and girls are treated differently in the family and  society. Girl children are subject to gender discrimination that include  abortion of female foetus and abandonment of girl children. Girls are denied  the right to education. Girl children are subject to gender discrimination  includes low level of employment, poor participation in decision-making and  politics, heavy work inside and outside home. Discrimination is very much  visible in all these aspects of women&rsquo;s life in society.<br>
      Mrs. Urmila Rao, President, Mahima Research Foundation  and Social welfare said that elimination of discrimination is a hard task,  especially in our country where diverse cultures have taken root, culture  influence attitudes, which also get entrenched deeply. Empowerment of women  will instill self confidence, essence of independence and capability in women  to resist discrimination imposed by male dominated society. There needs to be  an awakening in everybody. The united nation&rsquo;s commission on the status of  women in the fifty third session</span>s (2009) recognizes the gender inequalities  still exist and are reflected in imbalances of power between women and men in  all spheres of society.</p>
