      <p align="center"><strong>Annual Report of  Financial Year 2011-2012</strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>Annual meeting  of the Mahima Research Foundation and Social welfare was held on 3rd April  2012. The detail activities of the financial year 2011-2012 were discussed with  the participants due the meeting. On 12th June 2011, t<span style="text-align: justify">he foundation  organizes the meeting of &ldquo;Kishan Samridhi Gosthi&rdquo; in office of the Mahima  Research Foundation and Social Welfare, Karaundi, Varanasi. Ratnesh Kumar Rao informed that the agriculture forms the backbone of  Indian Economy and more than 70% of the population of this country depends on  this sector for its livelihood. Even after 60 years of planning and giving  utmost importance to programmes of industrialization approximately 60% of the  working population was engaged in agriculture in 2011 and this sector  contributed more than 50% of national income. Thus we can say that agricultural  development is the sinequanon of economic development and without it all talk  of economic progress is meaningless and futile. And when we talk of  agricultural development we imply the development of the whole rural sector in  an integrated  way and not merely  increase in agricultural production and productivity.<br>
        On 26-27  November 2011, the foundation organized two day National <strong>Conference</strong> &ldquo;<strong>Controlling  Environmental Pollution through Water Conservation for Sustainable Development&rdquo;</strong> on 26-27 December, 2011 at Seminar Hall, Department of Philosophy and Religion,  Faculty of Arts, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi <u>partially sponsored by  Council of Scientific Industrial Research, (CSIR), Govt. of India, New Delhi  and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),  Govt. of India, New Delhi</u>. It was inaugurated by <strong>Chief Guest Prof. R. P. Singh</strong>, Department of Genetics and Plant  Breading, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras  Hindu University,  Varanasi. In  this National conference <strong>free training</strong> and guidance were given to the <strong>220  participant&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>(farmers, teachers and  students)</strong> on 26th November 2011 at 9.00 AM.<br>
        On 28th  January 2011, the foundation organized the meeting on &ldquo;Mahila Sashaktikaran&rdquo; at  Seminar Hall, Mahima Research Foundation and Social welfare, 194, Karaundi,  BHU, Varanasi Mr. Ratnesh Kumar Rao, Secretary, Mahima Research Foundation and  Social Welfare said that it is well known that economic system of any country  from times immemorial, has needed and also benefited by the help, cooperation  and participation of women in the world of work. Since, primitive times, when  man lived on hunting down to the present 21st century, women have often been  found to cooperate with men in the economic front which gradually created a  distinct class of employed women in contemporary society. It was also observed  that the gaps between rural and urban female literacy rates are narrowing down.  It was observed that rural poverty acts as a push factors for women&rsquo;s education  rather than as an obstacle to women&rsquo;s education. The significant influence of  urbanization on women&rsquo;s education implied that urbanization had been playing a  beneficial role in the attainment of women&rsquo;s education in India. At the  same time, the drop-out rate had a negative effect on women&rsquo;s education. It  revealed that that reduction of girl&rsquo;s drop-out rates is necessary for  achieving women&rsquo;s education. Dr. Jayakant Kumar, Department of Social Science, Patana University,  Patna said that  democratic politics is one of the most coveted invention of human beings. Human  society has struggled since ancient times to achieve the goal of Democracy. It  is applicable not only for men but also for women. Women should not be deprived  in any matter. If the society is based on patriarchal values, her values in  male dominated society are to provide only to take care of the family and home  within the walls of the boundary. The poor women provide economic force i.e.  source of income to the lower class but, as they are illiterate, they lack  political consciousness or awareness. Collective empowerment through  representation and democratic process will give them voice, feelings of  solidarity and democratic politics. Affirmative action will build a critical  mass of local leadership of such groups will be active participants in the  strategic decision-making. If the women&rsquo;s political awareness is taken into  consideration, the rural urban dichotomy must be seen. The prevalent trend of  migration from rural to urban areas is related to women migration also. This  migration process has resulted in growing women&rsquo;s role in politics in Bihar. Not only this, the all round development which has  taken place during last four decades has also created scope of greater women&rsquo;s  participation in political activities. However, in the present study their  level of political roles will be judged by electoral participation figures.<br>
        It  has been found that usually these are young women of 25-45 years of age. 25% of  the women had previous political experience. The pattern caste representation  was the same as before the constitutional change, 65% of the elected  representative whether men or women were from dominant caste. Most of the women  elected were illiterate and above all the majority of women declared themselves  as homemakers. She found that women&rsquo;s experience of Panchayat Raj institution  has transformed many of them. The elements of this transformation include  empowerment, self-confidence, political awareness and affirmation of  information. We cannot expect more morality from an  educated fellow as now we are facing so much corruption at the high level.  Another instance can be taken to prove my stand that the women Sarapanch of the  Panchayat denied to open the Panchayat office and made logical argument before  the collector demanding more relief for the Panchayat.<br>
        On 9th February  2012, the foundation organized the Awareness Programme of &ldquo;Organic Farming&rdquo; at  Narottampur and Jakhani Village of Varanasi District. In this programme Ratnesh  Kumar Rao, Secretary, Mahima Research Foundation and Social welfare said that climate  change is one of the complex problems facing mankind today. It has engaged the  attention of the world and is an issue under intense debate. Already observed  changes are average higher temperatures and melting of polar ice sheets with  floods downstream, rising sea levels, increased pest incidence, increased  vector borne diseases and increased cyclones and tidal waves. Thus resulting in  food insecurity, water scarcity, sea level rise, floods, droughts, increased  occurrence of diseases such as malaria, etc. arc the potential climate change  threats. The frequent climate change, particularly low rainfall and warming has  posed serious threat to sustainable agriculture. Agricultural drought occurs  when there is insufficient soil moisture to meet the needs of a particular crop  at a particular time. A deficit of rainfall over cropped areas during critical  periods of the growth cycle can result in destroyed or underdeveloped crops  with greatly depleted yields.<br>
        On 26th  February 2012, the foundation organized Workshop on &ldquo;Organic Farming&rdquo; at  Seminar Hall, Mahima Research Foundation and Social welfare, 194, Karaundi,  BHU, Varanasi.  It was inaugurated by <strong>Chief Guest Dr.  Sunil Kumar Dubey</strong>, Director, Manas, Varanasi.  In this workshop <strong>free training</strong> and  guidance were given to the <strong>80  participant&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>farmers</strong> on 26th  February 2012 at 9.00 AM. Dr. Dubey said that Agriculture of any kind is  strongly influenced by the availability of water. Climate change will have an  impact on the predictability and variability in the availability of water and  also increase in frequencies of droughts and floods. Worst suffers would be  farmers of the rain fed agriculture. The risk of crop failures will increase in  semi-arid zone with prolonged dry seasons forcing people to migrate, when  stability of food production can not be assured. The demand for water for  irrigation is projected to rise in a warmer climate, bringing increased  competition between agriculture-already the largest consumer of water resources  in semiarid regions and urban as well as industrial users. Falling water tables  and the resulting increase in the energy needed to pump water will make the  practice of irrigation more expensive, particularly when with drier conditions  more water will be required per acre. Peak irrigation demands are also  predicted to-rise due to more severe heat waves. Additional investment for  darns, reservoirs, canals, wells, pumps, and piping may be needed to develop  irrigation networks in new locations. Finally, intensified evaporation will  increase the hazard of salt accumulation in the soil. Studies on the impact of  global warming conducted in Andhra Pradesh indicates the rise in temperature  will lead to an increase in water requirement of crops like maize, ground nut,  pigeon pea and cotton, through their growing duration will decrease by one to  two weeks. <br>
        Secretary  of the foundation said that higher air temperatures will also be felt in the  soil, where warmer conditions are likely to speed the natural decomposition of  organic matter and to increase the rates of other soil processes that affect  fertility. <br>
        Mrs. Urmila Rao,  President, Mahima Research Foundation and Social welfare said that there is a  need to integrate this indigenous knowledge with the scientific knowledge and  formulating policies which actively involve local communities in change  discourse and which secure their entitlements to self-determination, land,  natural resources, information, education, health services, and food. Besides,  the empowerment of the existing institutions, building awareness of traditional  adaptation and mitigation strategies, improving the social and physical  infrastructure, enhancing livelihood diversification, ensuring the conservation  of natural resources and biological diversity and promoting collaborative  research are essential parameters to avoid the potential impact of climate  change on agriculture.<br>
        On 30th March  2012, the foundation organized Workshop on &ldquo;Organic Farming&rdquo; at Seminar Hall,  Mahima Research Foundation and Social welfare, 194, Karaundi, BHU, Varanasi. It was  inaugurated by <strong>Chief Guest Dr. Snehlata</strong>,  Bihar University,  Bihar. In this workshop <strong>free training</strong> and guidance were given to the <strong>100 participant&rsquo;s farmers </strong>of<strong> Mirzapur, Chandauli </strong>and <strong>Varanasi</strong> district on 30th March 2012 at 11.00 AM. Dr. Snehlata said that India is provided with a broad spectrum of bio-diversity in  plants genetic resources and is to be recognized as one of the world&rsquo;s top  twelve mega diversity nations. It occupies rich flora that include about 45,000  species and many are recognized with medicinal value. More than 15,000 species  are used in different systems of health care in Asia (8,000 in India and 7,000 in China). Therefore efforts are  required to develop techniques for in-situand ex-situcultivation  of such medicinal plants which have been over harvested resulting in low  density of these species in nature. Cultivation of such species could reduce  the pressure on the natural habitat and will meet the market demand. The  cultivation of highly demanded medicinal plants can help for economic  development of rural population and also help for use of wastelands, provide  employment and income, supplying adequate raw materials for the medicine  manufacturing firms and development of double cropping system by mixing  medicinal plants with other crops like vegetables, gram, pea, maize and millet  etc. At present time cultivation of medicinal plants is not enough supported  with good agricultural practices like organic cultivation, sustainable harvest,  maturity level of harvesting and season of collection and the preferred habitat  for cultivation? Although few institutions involved in development of medicinal  plants sector in India.<br>
        Ratnesh  Kumar Rao, Secretary, Mahima Research Foundation and Social welfare said  that irrigation is the most important input required for the successful  Farming. Adoption of modern techniques and intensification of Agriculture are  not possible unless adequate irrigation facilities are available. The  variations in the levels of agricultural performance are significantly  associated with inequalities where intensity of irrigation is hardly under  20.00 percent to over 80 percent, it fails and productivity and the degree of  mechanization. As the population grew the demand of food also increased. The  increased demand of food forced the human beings to develop technologies for  enhancing crop productivity. New high yielding varieties, inorganic fertilizers  and new improved implements were developed. Growing food demand under limited  resource constraint is adoption of such technology which can help boost the  production and improve the input use efficiency. Main reason for low  productivity in this low lying belt was lack of awareness about improved  science and technology and the resource constraints due to poor economic  conditions of the farmers.<br>
        Mrs. Urmila  Rao, President, Mahima Research Foundation and Social welfare said that the impact of organic  agriculture on natural resources favours interactions within the agro-ecosystem  those are vital for both agricultural production and nature conservation.  Ecological services derived include soil farming and conditioning, soil stabilization  through buffering and structural improvement, waste recycling, car</span>bon  sequestration, nutrient cycling, predation, pollination and habitats. The  environmental costs of conventional agriculture are substantial, and the  evidence for significant environmental amelioration via conversion to organic  agriculture is over-whelming. There are also high pre-consumer human health  costs to conventional agriculture, particularly, in the use of pesticides.  <br>
        This immense commercialization of  agriculture has also had a very negative effect on the environment. The use of  pesticides has led to enormous levels of chemical buildup in our environment,  in soil, water, air, in animals and even in our own bodies. Fertilizers have a  short-term effect on productivity but a longer-term negative effect on the  environment where they remain for years after leaching and running off,  contaminating ground water and water bodies. </p>
