Urmila Devi said that <strong>the Government of India and state authorities alike have increasingly  realized the importance of devoting attention to the economic betterment and  development of rural women in India.  The Indian Constitution guarantees that there shall be no discrimination on the  grounds of gender. In reality, however, rural women have harder lives and are  often discriminated against with regard to land and property rights, and in  access to medical facilities and rural finance. Women undertake the more  onerous tasks involved in the day-to-day running of households, including the  collection of fuelwood for cooking and the fetching of drinking water, and  their nutritional status and literacy rates are lower than those of men.</strong> <br>

      <p><span style="text-align: justify">On 25th March 2014, the foundation  organized the &ldquo;<strong>Women Empowerment  Programme</strong>&rdquo; at 194, Karaundi, BHU, Varanasi. It was inaugurated by Dr. Sweta Kumari, Department of  Social Science, Magadh   University, Bodh Gaya. Dr.  Sweta Kumari said that Globalization has  presented new challenges for the realization of the goal of women&rsquo;s equality,  the gender impact of which has not been systematically evaluated fully.  However, from the micro-level studies that were commissioned by the Department  of Women &amp; Child Development, it is evident that there is a need for  re-framing policies for access to employment and quality of employment.  Benefits of the growing global economy have been unevenly distributed leading  to wider economic disparities, the feminization of poverty, increased gender  inequality through often deteriorating working conditions and unsafe working  environment especially in the informal economy and rural areas. Strategies will be designed to enhance the capacity of women and empower them  to meet the negative social and economic impacts, which may flow from the  globalization process. Equal access to education for women and girls will be  ensured. Special measures will be taken to eliminate discrimination,  universalize education, eradicate illiteracy, create a gender-sensitive  educational system, increase enrolment and retention rates of girls and improve  the quality of education to facilitate life-long learning as well as  development of occupation/vocation/technical skills by women.Reducing  the gender gap in secondary and higher education would be a focus area<em>.</em> Sectoral time targets in existing policies will be achieved, with a special  focus on girls and women, particularly those belonging to weaker sections  including the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes/Other Backward  Classes/Minorities. Gender sensitive curricula would be developed at all  levels of educational system in order to address sex stereotyping as one of the  causes of gender discrimination.<br>
        Dr. Sudha  Sinha, Head, Department of Philosophy, Magadh Mahila University, Patna said  that due to the lack of specific implementation plans and faulty  representations, local communities have not adequately accepted government and  private schemes for the upliftment of women. Women have not actively  participated in their own emancipation due to their lack of economic  independence and rampant illiteracy. Not long ago it was a socially accepted  Indian tradition that a woman&rsquo;s place was in her home and she was to perform  the duties of a wife and a mother. But many changes occurring in the Indian  society since the beginning of the 20th century in general and after  independence in particular, have forced women into new social roles. As a  result, the age-old customs and prejudices discouraging the employment of women  belonging to middle and upper middle class families have been fast  disappearing. Now they have entered not only into several gainful jobs of  different kinds but have also come out to take up jobs and positions in those  fields which </span>were tradition­ally the exclusive preserve of men. Minority status  combined with the prejudices against women pose limitations on them in  performing their new roles effectively. </p>
